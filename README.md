# Animal Simulator APCS
Fun project I did in AP Computer Science. Featuring Tigers and Squirrels placed randomly on a map, they fight to the death. While squirrels search for nuts, tigers search for squirrels. On a slim off-chance, zombies rise from the dead and zombie-squirrels can eat others of its own kind, and vice versa for Tigers!
